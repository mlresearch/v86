title: 'Learning via Social Awareness: Improving a Deep Generative Sketching Model
  with Facial Feedback'
abstract: A known deﬁcit of modern machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodology
  is that models must be carefully ﬁne-tuned in order to solve a particular task.
  Most algorithms cannot generalize well to even highly similar tasks, let alone exhibit
  signs of artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI). To address this problem, researchers
  have explored developing loss functions that act as intrinsic motivators that could
  drive an ML or DL agent to learn across a number of domains. This paper argues that
  an important and useful intrinsic motivator is that of social interaction. We posit
  that making an AI agent aware of implicit social feedback from humans can allow
  for faster learning of more generalizable and useful representations, and could
  potentially impact AI safety. We collect social feedback in the form of facial expression
  reactions to samples from Sketch RNN, an LSTM-based variational autoencoder (VAE)
  designed to produce sketch drawings. We use a Latent Constraints GAN (LC-GAN) to
  learn from the facial feedback of a small group of viewers, by optimizing the model
  to produce sketches that it predicts will lead to more positive facial expressions.
  We show in multiple independent evaluations that the model trained with facial feedback
  produced sketches that are more highly rated, and induce signiﬁcantly more positive
  facial expressions. Thus, we establish that implicit social feedback can improve
  the output of a deep learning model.
