title: 'A Study on Affect Model Validity: Nominal vs Ordinal Labels'
abstract: 'The question of representing emotion computationally remains largely unanswered:
  popular approaches require annotators to assign a magnitude (or a class) of some
  emotional dimension, while an alternative is to focus on the relationship between
  two or more options. Recent evidence in aﬀective computing suggests that following
  a methodology of ordinal annotations and processing leads to better reliability
  and validity of the model. This paper compares the generality of classiﬁcation methods
  versus preference learning methods in predicting the levels of arousal in two widely
  used aﬀective datasets. Findings of this initial study further validate the hypothesis
  that approaching aﬀect labels as ordinal data and building models via preference
  learning yields models of better validity.'
