title: Deep Ensembles for Inter-Domain Arousal Recognition
abstract: 'The computer science field Affective Computing, which studies and develops
  emotional intelligent systems, has been active for almost two decades now with limited
  results. Arousal as the dimension that represents the intensity of the emotions,
  represents similar recognition problems. This is the ﬁrst study that analyzes six
  publicly available datasets for arousal recognition from physiological signals and
  proposes a method capable of combining them. The novel method, an inter-domain Deep
  Neural Network (DNN) ensemble, is compared to classical machine learning (ML). For
  both methods, the raw data from Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Electrocardiography
  ECG, and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensors is processed and transformed into a common
  spectro-temporal space of R-R intervals and GSR data. For the classical ML algorithms,
  features are extracted, and for the DNN algorithms, two diﬀerent approaches were
  taken: a fully connected DNN trained with the same features as the classical ML
  algorithms (DNN-Features) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with
  the temporal representation of the GSR signal (CNN-GSR). Finally, a fully connected
  DNN meta learner is trained to utilize the knowledge from the two different DNNs
  and to tune the DNN models for the target dataset. The experimental results showed
  that the novel DNN ensemble method outperforms the classical ML methods and the
  non-ensemble DNN methods. Additionally, the CNN-GSR model learned that the peaks
  of the GSR signal contain the most information regarding the arousal, thus the network
  developed filters to emphasize those parts.'
