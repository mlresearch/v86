title: Binary Classification of Arousal in Built Environments using Machine Learning
abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a methodology and model to classify
  and characterize the arousal state of participants in a built environment. Demonstrating
  this showcases the potential of developing an intelligent system capable of both
  classifying and predicting biometric arousal state. This classiÔ¨Åcation process is
  traditionally performed by human experts. Our approach can be leveraged to take
  advantage of the diversity of real-time sensor data to inform the development of
  smart(er) environments to improve human health.
